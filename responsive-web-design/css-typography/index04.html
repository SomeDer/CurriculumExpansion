It's important to pick a typeface (or font) that has many different weights like regular, medium, and bold.
Google's Libre Franklin will work nicely.
Add the following link to the `head` element, just under the `title` element: 
`<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700,800" rel="stylesheet">`
