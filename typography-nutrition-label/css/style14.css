body {
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
  font-size: 16px;
}

.label {
  border: 2px solid black;
  width: 270px;
  margin: 20px auto;
  padding: 0 7px;
}

/*
If you inspect the label using your browser's developer tools, you'll see that it's actually 288 pixels wide instead of 270.
By default, your browser includes the dimensions of the border and padding when calculating the label's width (2px + 7px + 270px + 7px + 2px) or height.
An easy way to fix this is to use the universal `*` selector to target all elements on the page and set their `box-sizing` to `border-box`.
Add the following to the top of your CSS file, above the `body` rule:
```
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
