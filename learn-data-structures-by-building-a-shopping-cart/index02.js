/*
  Good job. 

  We will be building an online pastry shop and each food has special attributes that the store assigns to organize their inventories.

  Because a product has much information, more than a name, we will store it as an object. 

  There are few ways to create a JavaScript Object, the easiest way is to use object literal.

  To create object literal, we use curly brackets {}. 

  Objects use key value pairs separated by colons :. Key in a object is often called a property. For example, 
  
  const obj = {
    name: "Phillip"
  }

  This object has a key of name and string value of Phillip and is assigned to a variable called obj.

  Let's start making our first product. Insert an object as the first item inside products array. You don't have to assign the object to variables.

  Give the object a key called name and corresponding string of Vanilla buttercream cupcake
