const products = [];

/* 
  An online store usually hold many products in their inventory. Each product should have special attributes that the store assigns to fill their needs.

  Because a product has much information associated with it, we will store it as an object. 

  We will create our first item (object).

  There are few ways to create a JavaScript Object, the easiest way is to use object literal.

  To create object literal, use curly brackets. 

  Objects use key value pair separated by colons :. Object key is often called property. 
  
  For example, let's give an object a key of name and string value of Phillip. It will look like this. 
  
  const obj = {
    name: "Phillip"
  }

  Let's start making our first product. Insert an object as the first item inside products array. You don't have to assign the object to anything.

  Give it a key of name and corresponding value of Vanilla buttercream cupcake
