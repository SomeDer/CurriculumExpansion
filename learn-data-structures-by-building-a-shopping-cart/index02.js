/* 
  An online store usually hold many products in their inventory. Each product should have special attributes that the store assigns to fill their needs.

  Because a product has much information associated with it, we will store it as an object. 

  We will create our first item (object).

  Give it a property names of id, name and price and assign them values of 0, 'Vanilla buttercream cupcake' and 2.99 in order.

  It's notable that there are other common properties that an item can have such as category and quantity. We will keep it simple for this project.
