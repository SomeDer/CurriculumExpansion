const products = [];

/*
We have products array to hold our inventory and stocks.

Because the products in our online pastry shop have a lot of information, we will store each one as an object which is another type of data structure. 

Inside the products array, add an object with the property "name" and the value "Vanilla buttercream cupcake". 

For example, here is an array that contains a similar object:

const users = [
  {
    name: "Phillip"
  }
];
