/* 
A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a program. 

Arrays and objects are both common data structures you'll use in JavaScript. 

Declare a new variable using the 'const' keyword and name it 'products', then set it equal to an empty array. 

Here is an example of a variable 'users' that equals an empty array: 

const users = [];
