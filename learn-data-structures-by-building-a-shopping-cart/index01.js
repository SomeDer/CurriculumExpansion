A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a program.
An array is a simple data structure that can hold different types of values.
Declare a new variable using the 'const' keyword and name it 'products', then set it equal to an empty array.
Here is an example of a variable 'users' that equals an empty array:

const users = [];
