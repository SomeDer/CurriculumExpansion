/* 
A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a program.

Arrays and objects are both common data structures you'll use in JavaScript.

We will use an object as our primary data sturcture to mimic functionalities of a shopping cart.

Before building our shopping cart though, we will first need some products that we can work with.

Since there will be multiple products, we will use an array as our datasturcture to hold them. 

To declare an array, we need a set of brackets. For example:

const array = [];

Declare a new variable using 'const' keyword and name it 'products', then set it equal to an empty array;
