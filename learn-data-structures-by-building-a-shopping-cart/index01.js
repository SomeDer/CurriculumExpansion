/* 
A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a program.

Arrays and objects are both common data structures you'll use in JavaScript.

We will use an object as our primary data sturcture to mimic functionalities of a shopping cart.

First, we will need some data to work with. 

Declare a new variable using 'const' keyword and name it 'products', then set it equal to an empty array;
