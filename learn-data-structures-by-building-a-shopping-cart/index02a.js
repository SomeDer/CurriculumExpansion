Our delicious Vanilla buttercream cupcake needs more information for us to sell it.

Let's add additional keys and values. Give our cupcake properties of id and price. Match them with values 0 and 2.99 respectively.

When you add more key value pairs to an object, you separate them with commas. Here is an example:

{
  name: "Phillip",
  age: 29,
  gender: male
}
