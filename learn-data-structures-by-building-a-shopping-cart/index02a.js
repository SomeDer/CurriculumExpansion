/*
Good job. Now we have an cupcake in our store!

But we need give it more information.

When you add more key value pairs to an object, you separate them with commas. For example:

{
  name: "Phillip",
  age: 29
}

Give our first product additional properties of id and price. Match them with values 0 and 2.99 respectively.
