OK, We have actually filled up the rest of the products array with rest of the items to speed up the process.

Now that our shelves are full, let's build our shopping cart with a JavaScript class.

What are classes? It's container that makes it easy to define a number of methods to work with data and hold its current state.

In our case, think of it as a factory that can produce many number of shopping carts. 

They will look the same and do the same things. (unless given different parameters, which we won't cover in this lesson.)

To create a class, use a keyword called 'class' followed by a name then give opening and closing curly brackets. For ex.

class MyClass {

}

Declare a class called ShoppingCart.
