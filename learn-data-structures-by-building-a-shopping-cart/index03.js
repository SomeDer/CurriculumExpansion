We filled up the rest of the products array to speed up the process.
Now that our shelves are full, let's build our shopping cart with a JavaScript class.
A class is a container that makes it easy to define a number of methods to work with data and hold its current state.
Declare a class called ShoppingCart by using the class keyword followed by its name.
By convention, class names should start with a capital letter.
For example:

class Car {

}
