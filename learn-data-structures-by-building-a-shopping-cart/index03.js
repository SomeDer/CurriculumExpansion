We have actually filled up the rest of the products array with rest of the items to speed up the process.

Now that our shelves are full, let's build our shopping cart with a JavaScript class.

What are classes? It's container that makes it easy to define a number of methods to work with data and hold its current state.

To create a class, use a keyword called 'class'. For example:

class MyClass {

}

Declare a class called ShoppingCart.
