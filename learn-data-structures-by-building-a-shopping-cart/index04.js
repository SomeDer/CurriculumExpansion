/*
By convention, the first letter of class name is capital.

Classes are capable of maintaining states and have a special function called constructor that takes care of this concern.

Constructor will automatically initialize a state of an instance created from the class.

Let's create a constructor method inside the ShoppingCart class.

A method is just a function inside the class.

To declare a method inside class, you can simply give it a name, opening and closing parentheses to take in parameters then opening and closing curly brackets. For ex.

sayHello() {

}

Declare a method called 'constructor' inside the ShoppingCart class.
