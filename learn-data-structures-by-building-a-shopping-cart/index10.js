/*
We now need to create an instance or a copy off of our ShoppingCart class. This instance will always be an object.

This instance will have all the methods and the state to itself. Here is an example syntax:

class Person {
  ...
}
const person = new Person();

You need to use the 'new' keyweord to make an instance. 

Make an instance of ShoppingCart class and assign it to a variable called shoppingCart using const keyword.
