/*
Let's test our addItem and getItems methods!

Call addItem methods from our shoppingCart. Pass in 2 as our id and the global products array as our products array.

Then call getItems method to see what's returned from the array. For ex:

ourInstance.method(10, clothesArray);
ourInstance.printItems();
