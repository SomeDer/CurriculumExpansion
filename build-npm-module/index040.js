/**
 * You can enter a version number for you package here.
 * Version numbers are typically three numbers separated by a period, for example, 1.2.6.
 * The first number is the major revision number for when significant changes are made.
 * The second number represents minor changes like bug fixes or other minor features.
 * The third number is for minor changes like small updates or bug fixes.
 * npm init defaults to version 1.0.0, so just hit enter again.
