// now you can run your server by typing `node server` in your terminal
// console and accessed the server from your browser with this address:
// `http://localhost:8080` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
// usually we write `console.log()` at the end of the code to let us know
// that the server is already running.
// write `console.log()` and write your own notification that the server
// is running at port 8080.
