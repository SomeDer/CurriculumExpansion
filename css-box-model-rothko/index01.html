<!--
We've created a `<div>` element with the class `canvas` to build our painting off of.
In *style.css*, write a CSS rule that uses the `.canvas` class selector and set its `width` to 500 pixels.
Here's a CSS rule that sets the width of the class `box` to 300 pixels:
```
.box {
  width: 300px;
}
```
